[42 The Network](https://www.42network.org/) Assignment:
-----------

This is an introduction to base c++ concepts using a series of short projects. 
Each subject aims at introducing or detailing specific concepts. 

Requirements:
-------------
- You are allowed to use almost everything from the standard library. Thus, instead of sticking to what you already know, it would be smart to use as much as possible
the C++-ish versions of the C functions you are used to.
- However, you canâ€™t use any other external library. It means C++11 (and derived forms) and Boost libraries are forbidden. The following functions are forbidden
too: *printf(), *alloc() and free(). 
- Unless explicitly stated otherwise in each assignment, the using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords are forbidden.
- You are allowed to use the STL in the Module 08 and 09 only. That means: no Containers (vector/list/map/and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that requires to include the <algorithm> header) until then.
